ORGANIZING WILL MAKE IT EASIER FOR THE DEV TO FIND FILES THEY NEED. EVEN
THE CODE HAS BEEN ORGANIZED IN A WAY SO THAT CHUNKS THAT BELONG WITH 
EACHOTHER ARE TOGETHER. VARIABLES ARE ORGANIZED BY LOAD TYPE AND 
ALPHABETICAL ORDER.

FILES SHOULD BE EASIER CUZ AALL YOU GOTTA DO IS SEND THE FILE TO THE MAIN 
GUY AND NAME IT PROPERLY SO HE CAN FIND IT LATER WHEN THINGS GET TOO BIG 
FOR A SIMPLE GLANCE. HE CAN JUST FIND IT USING SEARCH.

CHECK BELOW FOR INSTRUCTIONS.
